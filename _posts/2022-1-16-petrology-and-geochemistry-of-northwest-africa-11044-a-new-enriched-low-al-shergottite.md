**Abstract**:   
Petrographic, mineral compositional, and whole rock geochemical analysis of two slightly weathered stones weighing 95.3 and 9.4 grams recovered from the Moroccan Sahara in 2016 (NWA 11044) determined they belong to the low-Al group of enriched basaltic shergottites. We present preliminary results of Northwest Africa 11044 in this report. We compare it to other known low-Al shergottites. Radiogenic study is currently under way.
