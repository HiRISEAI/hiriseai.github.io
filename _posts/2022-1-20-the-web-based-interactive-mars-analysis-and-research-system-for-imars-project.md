**Abstract**:   

We describe the web-based interactive Mars Analy- sis and Research System (iMARS web-GIS), special- ized on planetary surface change analysis with novel tools for simultaneous visualization of single images as time series in their original sequence. As the data foundation, we use the vast quantity of auto- matically co-registered ortho-images and digital ter- rain models (DTM) from three NASA missions’ in- struments processed and ingested in the context of the EU-funded iMars project [1]. The baseline for the co-registered images are the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) multi-orbit quadrangle image mosaics, which are based on bundle-block-adjusted multi-orbit DTM mosaics. Additionally we make use of the existing along-track bundle-adjusted HRSC sin- gle images and DTMs available at the planetary data archives. A web mapping application including the presented functionality has been implemented and is available at http://imars.planet.fu-berlin.de with the iMars project website (http://www.i-mars.eu/web-gis) serving as a mirror. The system has been built by using solely open source software, and the additional devel- opments are publicly available.
