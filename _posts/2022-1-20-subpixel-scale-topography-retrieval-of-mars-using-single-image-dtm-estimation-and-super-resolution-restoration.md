**Abstract**:   

We propose using coupled deep learning based super-resolution restoration (SRR) and single-image digital terrain model (DTM) estimation (SDE) methods to produce subpixel-scale topography from single-view ESA Trace Gas Orbiter Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging System (CaSSIS) and NASA Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) images. We present qualitative and quantitative assessments of the resultant 2 m/pixel CaSSIS SRR DTM mosaic over the ESA and Roscosmos Rosalind Franklin ExoMars roverâ€™s (RFEXM22) planned landing site at Oxia Planum. Quantitative evaluation shows SRR improves the effective resolution of the resultant CaSSIS DTM by a factor of 4 or more, while achieving a fairly good height accuracy measured by root mean squared error (1.876 m) and structural similarity (0.607), compared to the ultra-high-resolution HiRISE SRR DTMs at 12.5 cm/pixel. We make available, along with this paper, the resultant CaSSIS SRR image and SRR DTM mosaics, as well as HiRISE full-strip SRR images and SRR DTMs, to support landing site characterisation and future rover engineering for the RFEXM22.
