The following are the HiRISEAI collages of images presented at the Clark County Library Art Gallery. Not all of them are real. Some images are actually synthetic images generated by training StyleGAN with HiRISE images of Martian landscapes. Among all the collages, there's only one which is made of all synthetic images. In some ollages, only one image is synthetic. Could you tell which one is real and which one is fake?
