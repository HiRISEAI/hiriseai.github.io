An element map is an image showing the spatial distribution of elements in a sample. Element maps can display element distribution in textual context, particularly for showing compositional zonation. Element mapping is typically done in an SEM or TEM using EDS anaysis. a high resolution image of the area of interest is collected along with the EDS data, and the two are correlated.

Anthony Love, from the Appalachian State University gave us a terrific Zoom talk on Martian meteorites and element mapping. The following is a recorded video of his talk.
