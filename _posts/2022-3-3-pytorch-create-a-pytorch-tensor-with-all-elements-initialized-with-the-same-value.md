The Iris dataset consists of 3 different types of irises: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, and Iris Virginica, and 4 features of length and wideth of sepals and petals. The dataset can be found in the [UCI Machine learning Repository - Iris data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris){:target="_blank"}.

The Iris dataset is the best known dataset in the pattern recognition literature. Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. The dataset contains 3 types of 50 instances each. One type is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOt linearly seperable from each other. The predicted attibute is type of iris. The four attributes are: sepal length in cm, sepal width in cm, petal length in cm, and petal width in cm.

Here's Fisher's paper [*The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x){:target="_blank"}.

The sepals of a flower are the outer structures that protect the more fragile parts of the flower, such as the petals. Many sepals are green. The sepals of an iris are larger than the petals and are drooping while the petals are upright.
