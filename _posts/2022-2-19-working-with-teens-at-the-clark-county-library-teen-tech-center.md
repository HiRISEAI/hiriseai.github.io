In the Saturday afternoon, at the Best Buy Teen Tech Center, I brought with me two ordinary chondrites and one tiny Martian meteorite to the teens hanging around in the room and the neighboring room. The Teen Tech Center is located at the Clark County Libary in a minority neighborhood in Vegas. There's at least one staff who were workign there accomodating with these teens. One woman staff was so good with the teens, as I could tell. I think she is just a very friendly person in nature and she is good with teens. If I were one of the teens over there I would definitely try to make friends with her. She was like a sister to everybody, warm and amiable. 

There were six teens hanging around, and three of them joined me. They were all girls from the neighboring high schools. I didn't feel that they were as fascinated by the meteorites like I did. I always loved space rocks for each time I saw a new one that would bring me great joy. Also, this was their first time ever to code on Google Colab and create programs with Python. Our fist program was coding a shopping list and the second is creating the fibonacci sequence. I've already posted the two programs on my GitHub, which seemed quite helpful. They liked the shopping list program right away.

Here's the shopping list program: [https://github.com/rocks2021/Colabs-for-HiRISEAI/blob/main/1_shoppinglist.ipynb](https://github.com/rocks2021/Colabs-for-HiRISEAI/blob/main/1_shoppinglist.ipynb){:target="_blank"}.

And the fibonacci sequence program: [https://github.com/rocks2021/Colabs-for-HiRISEAI/blob/main/2_fibonacci.ipynb](https://github.com/rocks2021/Colabs-for-HiRISEAI/blob/main/2_fibonacci.ipynb){:target="_blank"} 

As I could tell, they liked coding and the had that sense of achievement on their face once they got their Colabs to work. I hope they would continue learning more coding, math, Martian science, our program on HiRISEAI, or anything good for their future.
