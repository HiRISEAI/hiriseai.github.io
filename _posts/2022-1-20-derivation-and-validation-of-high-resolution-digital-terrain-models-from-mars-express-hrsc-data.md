**Abstract**:   
The High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) onboard the Mars Express mission is the first photogrammetric stereo sensor system employed for planetary remote sensing. The derivation of high-quality digital terrain models is subject to
a variety of parameters, some of which show a significant variability between and also within individual datasets. Therefore, adaptive processing techniques and the use of efficient quality parameters for controlling automated process- ing are considered to be key requirements for DTM generation. We present the general procedure for the derivation of HRSC high-resolution DTM, representing the core element of the systematic derivation of high-level data products by the Mars Express HRSC experiment team. We also analyze test series applying specific processing variations, including a new method for signal adaptive image preprocessing. The results are assessed based on internal quality measures and com- pared to external terrain data. Sub-pixel scale 3D point accuracy of better than 10 m and a DTM spatial resolution of up to 50 m can be achieved for large parts of the surface of Mars within a reasonable effort. This confirms the potentials of the applied along-track multiple stereo imaging principle and allows for a considerable improvement in our knowledge of the topography of Mars.
