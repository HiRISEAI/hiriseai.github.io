**Abstract** NASA has acquired more than 22 million images from the planet Mars. To help users find images of interest, we devel- oped a content-based search capability for Mars rover surface images and Mars orbital images. We started with the AlexNet convolutional neural network, which was trained on Earth im- ages, and used transfer learning to adapt the network for use with Mars images. We report on our deployment of these clas- sifiers within the PDS Imaging Atlas, a publicly accessible web interface, to enable the first content-based image search for NASA’s Mars images.
