[Identifying Community Needs for a Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) Data Catalog](https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2020/pdf/1709.pdf){:target="_blank"}

Proceedings of the 51st Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2020), Abstract #1709

**Summary**:   
We are creating a user-centered catalog of MER data in order to reduce the barriers of entry for workers who were not on the MER team; the catalog is not intended to be a duplicate or replacement for the MER Analyst’s Notebook, but rather an entry point for those unfamiliar with the mission. We seek to design and develop a database architecture that will be flexible enough to expand the data catalog to additional rover missions, and we will make the architecture publicly available. We will expand the Mars workforce by hiring capable catalogers who would not follow the traditional academic path into planetary science. Cataloging 7321 sols’ worth of data will require an extended period of time; we will prioritize our cataloging efforts according to community need as determined by our survey of potential catalog users. We highly encourage the reader with an interest in using MER data
to take our survey, available at http://www.merdatacatalog/survey. Our goal is for everyone – senior research scientist, graduate student, undergraduate, museum visitor, space enthusiast, future astronaut standing on Husband Hill in Gusev Crater – to be able to easily find and use Spirit and Opportunity data of interest to them.
