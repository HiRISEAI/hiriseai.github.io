**Description**:  
Dr. Daisuke Ikeda from Kyushu University of Japan will give us a Zoom presentation on A Hands-on Approach to the Sampling Theorem. Computer science education for kids has received considerable attention. However, we can hardly find educational cases for kids in information science, compared to computational science, such as programming. Aiming to develop classes and their materials about information science for kids, the author has tried to develop lectures to deliver core ideas of the Fourier transform, which is an important topic of information science, using the notion of average. However, these lectures did not include the sampling theorem, which plays an important role when we decide the sampling rate when digitizing analog data, and thus it is essential in information science. One of the challenges to incorporate it to lessons for kids is that it is necessary to explain notions of the wave and its frequency while lectures about the Fourier transform itself do not require these notions since the author explains the main idea of it using average. To incorporate the sampling theorem into our lectures, the author tried to explain waves and frequencies by timing. In this paper, the author shares experiences extending already developed lectures so that they include the sampling theorem. One important feature of these lessons is that we have used many hands-on materials. For the sampling theorem, the author also uses an equipment, called "water pearl", which makes us confuse that droplets of dropping water seem to be climbing up when we see it through flashing light. This is useful when we learn basic ideas of the sampling theorem because this phenomenon happens when two frequencies of dropping and flashing are appropriately selected. In this paper, the author also explain how we use this equipment to explain the sampling theorem. Keywords: Information Theory, Fourier Transform, Sampling Theorem, Average, Vector Space, Inner Product.
