**Abstract**:   
An approach for the automated detection of dune fields on remotely sensed images of the surface of Mars is presented in this letter. It is based on the extraction of local information from images (i.e., gradient features), which, in turn, is tested with boosting and support vector machine classifiers. A detection rate of about 95% is obtained for fivefold cross validation on a set of 78 panchromatic images captured by the Mars Orbiter Camera of the Mars Global Surveyor probe on different locations of the planet.
