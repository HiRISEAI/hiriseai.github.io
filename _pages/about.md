HiRISEAI is centered on the question: "Where would a good Mars landing location be situated for exploration and to return rocks to Earth?" 

We lost two colleagues during the Covid-19 pandemic: Peter Faught (Experimental Tesing/Prototype Enigneer) and Shane Bevel (Director of Communications). We wouldn't have been able to get funded without Peter and Shane. They will always be in our heart.

**Our Team**:  
- Ping Wang (Principal Investigator)
- Dr. Eugene Smith 
- Dr. Racheal Johnsen
- Erich Liang
- Dr. Chris DeFelice

**Our Website**:  

Many images we are using on this website are HiRISE images of Martian landscapes. We download the jpg images from the [HiRISE website](https://www.uahirise.org/){:target="_blank"} and split every one of them into a 512x512 px squares. All the image file names are kept the same as on the HiRISE website.  

This website is written in Markdown in order to honor a noted contributor to Markdown, Aaron Swartz, who was alson one of the early architects of Creative Commons and a developer of the Internet Archives' Open Library.
