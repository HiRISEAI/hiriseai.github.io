HiRISEAI is a NASA-funded STEM project focused on the HiRISE images of Martian landscapes and other image data from Mars explorations. In this project, we strive to meet the needs of our high school students and their families in southern Nevada as well as the public at large by serving as a uniquely rich resource of materials and information through exhibits, education, research, and public service. The goal of the project is to inspire innovators locally and globally.
 

**Our Team**:  
- Ping Wang (Principal Investigator)
- Dr. Eugene Smith
- Dr. Racheal Johnsen
- Shalee Okelberry
- Erich Liang
- Dr. Chris DeFelice
- Dr. Helen Zhang

We lost two colleagues during the Covid-19 pandemic: Peter Faught (Experimental Tesing/Prototype Enigneer) and Shane Bevel (Director of Communications). We wouldn't have been able to get funded without Peter and Shane. They will always be in our heart.  

**Our Website**:  

Many images we are using on this website are HiRISE images of Martian landscapes. We download the jpg images from the [HiRISE website](https://www.uahirise.org/){:target="_blank"} and split every one of them into 512x512 px squares. All the image file names are kept the same as on the HiRISE website.  

This website is written in Markdown in order to honor a noted contributor to Markdown, Aaron Swartz, who was also one of the early architects of Creative Commons and a developer of the Internet Archives' Open Library.

**Our Supporters**:  

*As of February 2022*
