HiRISEAI is centered on the question: "Where would a good Mars landing location be situated for exploration and to return rocks to Earth?" 

We lost two colleagues during the Covid-19 pandemic: Peter Faught (Experimental Tesing/Prototype Enigneer) and Shane Bevel (Director of Communications). We wouldn't be able to get funded without Peter and Shane. They will always be in our heart.

**Our Team**:  
- Ping Wang (Principal Investigator)
- Dr. Eugene Smith 
- Erich Liang

- Dr. Michael Nicholl

**Our Website**:  
Many images we are using on this website are HiRISE images of Martian landscapes. We download the jpg images from the [HiRISE website](https://www.uahirise.org/){:target="_blank"} and split every one of them into a 512px by 512 px squares. All the image file names are kept the same as on the HiRISE website.
